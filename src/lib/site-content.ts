    "Before entering the field of special education, I spent several years working in the corporate world, building my career in sales and business development. Those years taught me the importance of communication, discipline, planning, and building meaningful relationships.",
    "Life then took me in a different direction. As a parent of a child with autism, I found myself learning, unlearning, and understanding the world of special education in a way I had never imagined. What began as a personal journey to support my own child gradually became a professional calling.",
    "Over the years, I pursued formal qualifications as an RCI Certified Special Educator (Autism) and continued to deepen my knowledge through specialized training in areas such as Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD), AAC, and Primitive Reflex Integration. Every course I completed had one purpose—to become better equipped to support children and their families.",
    "Turtle Wings is an extension of that journey. It is a place where I hope to create structured, meaningful learning opportunities not only for my own son, but also for many other children with autism. My vision is to build a supportive environment where children can learn with confidence, parents feel understood, and every small step of progress is valued.",
